Don't you wish you could hear something like this every time you cracked a funny joke?


That's the sound of a crowd of neural network generated laughter. It takes advantage of some recent work done in multi-speaker speech synthesis. 

This is the first of a two-part post. In this post I'll give an overview of the way the speech synthesis works and use the laugh track generation as a toy example. By the end of the second, I'll demonstrate how we can use this sort of technology to provide voiceovers (dub) a non-English clip with English audio.
