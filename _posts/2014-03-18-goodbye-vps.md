title: Goodbye VPS
---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the new Sunny Days. The move from a VPS provider to Github pages had several motivations, which I'll lay out in an only roughly ordered way. From a cost perspective, Github pages is a no brainer -- it's free. In addition, it is also more convenient to edit some files locally and push the results out, all in clean markdown. I wanted to spend less time formatting my posts and just get the words out faster. I also realized that I did not have a need to run a server when hosted static files could do the trick; most of my projects can run completely clientside. In the future, should I need server side capabilities I will most likely be making use of Digital Ocean credits that I've been racking up at the hackathons around here, or perhaps a micro EC2 instance.
