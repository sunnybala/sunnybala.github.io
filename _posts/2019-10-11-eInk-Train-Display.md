I commute by train to my office every day, so my schedule ends up being tightly coupled to the train schedule. Far too frequently, I make my way to the platform at the end of the day only to see something like this:

Cancellations and delays. I could check the app every day when I'm thinking of leaving but I wanted to have something I could glance at. I built this little pi-powered gadget to stick above my monitor that grabs the times and keeps me in the loop!

.center {
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
